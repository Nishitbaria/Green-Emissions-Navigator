The footprint of a flight travel is calculated based on the distance between airports and the travelling class of the passenger. With the origin and destination as inputs and following the ICAO methodology and EPA emissions factors, we apply appropriate rules based on research by IPCC.",

        "This computes the emissions from stationary combustion fuels which are burnt in a fixed unit or asset owned or controlled by the reporting organization, and usually reported as a Scope 1 direct emission [1]. The source of data and methodology of emission factor calculation are from UK government's GHG conversion factors for company reporting and Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)'s data of 2022 from New Zealand. All emissions are expressed as kg of CO2 equivalent per unit [2].",
